# About Me
Hello! I’m Zulfikharali, though in this digital space, I go by Komorebi.

I am a Software Engineer by trade, but a seeker of "filtered light" by nature. My life is a blend of logical patterns and the atmospheric (music and photography). I find my rhythm in the balance between technical precision and the creative flow of my personal passions.

## Why "Komorebi"?
Komorebi (木漏れ日) is the Japanese word for sunlight filtering through the leaves of trees. To me, it is more than a beautiful visual; it is the interplay between the intricate and the luminous. It represents those rare, quiet moments where clarity breaks through complexity, and the ordinary is suddenly transformed by light.
