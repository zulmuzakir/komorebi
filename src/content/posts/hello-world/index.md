Hello, and welcome. This is the first entry in this digital space.

I've stared at this blank screen for longer than I care to admit. As a developer, "Hello, World" is usually the easiest part.

```go
fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
```

```rust
println!("Hello, World!");
```

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
```

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Whether it's Go, Rust, or C++, we all start from the same place. It's the universal handshake between a programmer and a new machine.
But when you’re building a space for your own thoughts, those two words feel a lot heavier.

I choose the name of <b>Komorebi</b> because I like the meaning of that words: "the scattered light that filters through when sunlight shines through trees"
